      <h1>‚ùîHow to play the "Pig Game"</h1>
      <p>
        <strong> Objective</strong>: The goal is to be the first player to reach
        or exceed a certain number of points, usually 100. <br />

        <strong> Gameplay</strong>: Players take turns rolling the die. On a
        turn, a player rolls the die and accumulates points as follows: <br />
        - If the player rolls a 1, they score no points for that turn, and it
        becomes the next player's turn. <br />
        - If the player rolls a number other than 1, they can choose to: <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End their turn and keep the points rolled
        during that turn.<br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Roll the die again and potentially accumulate
        more points. <br />
        <strong> Accumulating Points </strong>: As long as the player continues
        to roll numbers other than 1, they keep accumulating points on that
        turn. They can roll as many times as they want on their turn until they
        choose to end their turn or roll a 1. <br />
        <strong>Ending Turn</strong>: A player can choose to end their turn at
        any point before rolling a 1. If they do so, they add all the points
        accumulated during that turn to their total score. <br /><strong
          >Rolling a 1</strong
        >: If a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points accumulated during
        that turn, and their turn ends. It becomes the next player's turn.
        <br />
        <strong>Winning the Game</strong>: The first player to reach or exceed
        the target score (usually 100) wins the game. If multiple players reach
        the target score in the same round, the player with the highest score
        wins.
